## Description
We want to create a heat map of London to show people which areas to avoid at certain times. We also want to provide a pathfinder that shows the user the best route to take.
Therefore we use a dataset called UTD19 (https://utd19.ethz.ch/) and extract the necessary sensor data for the city of London. With the data, we compute a regression and make a prediction. 
We then visualize the obtained information with a grid over London.

## Disclaimer
Most Jupyter notebooks are not executable due to file or library imports. For testing, please run our Python scripts like create_dataset.py test_train_split_function.py
Our scientific report, Traffic Status, includes a detailed description of why this happens.
