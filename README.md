## Description
We want to create a heat map of London to show people which areas to avoid at certain times. We also want to provide a pathfinder that shows the user the best route to take.
Therefore we use a dataset called UTD19 (https://utd19.ethz.ch/) and extract the necessary sensor data for the city of London. With the data we compute a regression and make a prediction. 
We then visualize the obtained information with a grid over London.
